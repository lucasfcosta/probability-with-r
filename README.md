# probability-with-r

✒️Somewhere to keep my notes for probability and R studies.

Files here are organized according to the course's weekly program.

Most of it will be pretty basic and repetitive but I'll go through all of it again to make sure I didn't miss any details. I believe doing that will also be useful for any newcomers coming to this repo with zero knowledge on any of this.

Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:lucas@lucasfcosta.com) if you want to chat or ask anything related to this.
