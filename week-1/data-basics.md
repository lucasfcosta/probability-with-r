# Variable Types

Variables can be classified in:

* Numerical variables if they (obviously) are numerical → **Quantitative**
    * Continuous variables → if they can take an infinite number of values
        * Time
        * Temperature
        * Pressure
    * Discrete variables → if they can take only non-negative integers from a specific set of values
        * Shoe numbers (US/UK/EU)
        * Age in years
* Categorical variables if they are not numerical → **Qualitative**
    * Ordinal → when categories have a natural ordering
        * Satisfaction levels (Low/Medium/High(
        * HDI
    * Non-ordinal → when categories cannot be ordered
        * Body types
        * Eye color

# Variable Relationships

**Variables connected to each other** are called **associated** (dependent).

Association between variables can be further described as **positive or negative** depending on the influence on has in another's value.
