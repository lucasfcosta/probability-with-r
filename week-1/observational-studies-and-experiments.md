# Explanatory and Response Variables

* Explanatory variables are the variables we're trying to use to prove a certain output
* Response variables are the variables which represent a certain output


# Observational Studies and Experiments

Studies can be classified into:

* **Observational** Studies
    * Observational studies collect data in a way that does not interfere with the way data arises. They merely observe it.
    * **On these studies we can only establish an association (correlation) between the explanatory and the response variable** (I'm gonna simplify this here and not mention advanced techniques that might allow us to do that).
    * They can be further classified into:
        * Retrospective studies → when it uses past data
        * Prospective studies → when data is collected throughout the study
* **Experiments**
    * Experiments randomly assign subjects to treatments.
    * **Experiments can establish causal relationships between explanatory and response variables**.


# Correlation versus Causation

Observational studies **cannot** establish causation relationships because without being able to forcefully isolate and control a certain variable, there might be other explanations for what has been observed other than the variable we look at.

For example:

When seeing an observational study which observed that slim people usually do not skip breakfast, we cannot necessarily conclude that skipping breakfast makes people slim.

All of the following might be true:

1. Skipping breakfast makes people slim
2. People do not skip breakfast because they are slim
3. A third variable, such as waking up early, might cause people to not skip breakfast **and** be slim

In the third case, that third extraneous variable which implies in both the explanatory and the response variable changing can be called a **confounder variable**.
