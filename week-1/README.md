# Week 1

# Learning Objectives

* Identify variables as numerical or categorical
    * For numerical variables (quantitative)
        * Continuous variables → infinite number of values within a given range
        * Discrete variables → taken on one of a specific set of numeric values
    * For categorical variables (qualitative)
        * Ordinal or non-ordinal - based on whether the levels have a natural ordering
* Define related variables (associated variables) and independent variables
* In a pair of variables, identify the one which affects the other
* Differentiate observational and experimental studies
    * Explain whether the study's results can be generalized to a population
        * Random sampling when collecting data → generalizable
    * Suggest correlation or causation relationships between quantities
        * Random assignment in study design → causality
* Learn to identify confounding variables and sources of biases in studies
* Distinguish between different sampling schemes
    * Simple random sampling → equal probability of each subject being selected
    * Stratified sampling → picking subjects from homogeneous strata and then randomly sample from within each strata
    * Cluster sampling → divide the population into clusters with non-homogeneous subjects but with clusters being similar to each other and them randomly sample from each cluster
* Identify principals of experimental design and recognize their purposes
    * Control possible confounders
    * Randomize into treatment and control groups
    * Replicate
        * By using a sufficiently large sample
        * By repeating the experiment
    * Block any variables that might influence the response
* Identify single or double binding
