# Sampling and Sources of Bias


## Census Versus Sampling

A common question that arises in people's minds is:

> Why not just conduct a census?

Oh well, a census is obviously extremely hard to conduct because it requires every subject of the population to be consulted, which is something extremely costly and hard to do due to especially when it comes to finding certain subjects and getting them to answer forms. An example of this is the difficulty to accurately represent data about illegal immigrants in the US since they might be afraid of this data being shared with immigration authorities.

Populations also rarely stand still, which makes this even harder.

On the other hand, samples feel very natural and they can be accurate enough as long as the sampling technique chosen fits the purpose of the study.

By analysing a certain sample of a population we can say you are doing an exploratory analysis and then when exagerating these conclusions to the whole population we can say you are doing an inference. **For this inference to be valid your sample must be representative of the entire population studied**.


# Sources of bias

Common sources of bias can include:

* Convenience sample → including only individuals who are easily acessible and thefore causing them to be over-represented in the sample
* Non response → happens when a non-random fraction of the sampled subjects responds to a survey such that the sample is no longer representative of the netire population
* Voluntary response → having a survey to which only people that feel more strongly engaged with a certain cause or subject respond to might also cause the sample to no longer be representative


# Sampling methods

* Simple random sample → when subjects are randomly picked from the entire population.
* Stratified sample → when the subjects are divided into homogeneous groups (strata) and then picked randomly from within each group
* Cluster sample → when the subjects are divided into clusters that are heterogeneous within themselves but similar to one another and then this allows us to randomly pick a few clusters and sample all observations within these clusters
* Multistage sample → adds another step to cluster sampling by allowing us to pick individuals from within the picked clusters instead of sampling all of the subjects in it
